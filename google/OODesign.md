first know what kind of elevator

is there only one elevator serving that building or multiple elevators serving the building simultaneously,

there many floors in the building, Maybe there are some users in different floor pressing the button simultaneously,


This results in some requests to RequestProcessCenter for processing.The  RequestProcessCenter figure out the first request that need to be processed in such an algorithm that the distance between target floor and current floor is shortest.

```
public class User {

    Request req = new Request(toFloor)
    RequesrProcessCenter center = RequestProcessCenter.getInstance()
    canter.addRequest(req)
}

public class

```
